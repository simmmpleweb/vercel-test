description: Routing path system
---

We've created these dynamic routes, so we wouldn't have to write them in two
places. On place would have been inside our `Sidebar` and the onther one would
be either the `src/RTL.js` layout or the `src/Admin.js`layout. You will find all
our demo routes in `src/routes.js`

Please note that these are just demo routes. You can delete them and create your
own routing system, or you can easily replace them with normal
[Routes](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route?ref=horizon-documentation)
and
[Links](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link?ref=horizon-documentation)
or
[NavLinks](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/NavLink?ref=horizon-documentation)
from
[react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic?ref=horizon-documentation).
If you do not understand them, please take in consideration replacing them with
normal routes and use the `src/routes.js` just for rendering Links inside the
Sidebar component.

```tsx
{ path: "/path/name", name: "Name Of the View", rtlName: "اسم العرض", icon: <Icon />, component: ViewComponent, layout: "/layout-path" },
```

## Legend

- `path` (path for your route - this will be seen in the browser url input -
  example `/dashboard`)
- `name`(name of your route - this will appear in the `Sidebar` and `Navbar`
  components - example `Dashboard`)
- `rtlName` (name of your route - this will appear in the `Sidebar` and `Navbar`
  components - example `لوحة القيادة` if `rtlActive` prop is set on the
  `Sidebar` and `Navbar` components)
- `icon` (icon to be displayed alongside with links in `Sidebar` component -
  example `<DocumentIcon color="inherit" />`)
- `component` (this is the View component that you want to be displayed on the
  specified route - example `Dashboard`)
- `layout` (path of the layout in which the View component you want to be
  rendered - in our template demo you only have to options: `/admin` and
  `/rtl` - but due to this routing system you can add more, for example
  `/new-layout`)

For a better understanding, please take a look inside the file at hand, and also
how the routes are rendered while the app si opened.

## Notice

Because our routes are arrays of objects, and each route is an object, you can
add what props you want in our routes and do what you want with them.
