title: Sidebar
package: "@chakra-ui/navigation"
description:
  The component where all the page links are located. It works like a menu.
---

It has an option to set the brand text (`logoText`), an option to set the logo
image (`logo`), an option to choose between opaque and transparent modes and an
option to set the routes / links to be displayed in it (`routes`).

For more info about the links, please read the routing system section.

Inside the same `Sidebar.js` file, there is a `SidebarResponsive()` component,
which is a button that opens a drawer which only appears on smaller viewports.
It has the same props as the normal `Sidebar`, besides the opacity mode.

## Example of code

This is the actual code for the `Sidebar` in our demo app.

```js
import Sidebar from "components/Sidebar/Sidebar.js"
import appRoutes from "routes/app.js"
import logo from "assets/img/reactlogo.png"
```

```js
<Sidebar routes={appRoutes} logoText={"DASHBOARD"} variant="opaque" {...rest} />
```

## Props
