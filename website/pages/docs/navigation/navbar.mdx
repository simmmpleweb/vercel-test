  Navbar is the most abstract component on top of which all other Purity UI
  components are built.

You will find this component in `src/components/Navbars/AdminNavbar.js`. In this
component there is just the structure of the navbar. The links can be found in
`src/components/Navbars/AdminNavbarLinks.js`. We've done this because on
responsive we want both the links from `Navbar` and those from `Sidebar`
components to be displayed.

From the configurator opened by the `SettingsIcon` from withing the `Navbar`,
you can change the type of the Navbar (sticky or not sticky).

There is also a `AuthNavbar` used for the `/Auth layout`. It is located in
`src/components/Navbars/AuthNavbar.js`. Depending on the route property
`secondaryNavbar`, the navbar changes styles in a specific way (see the
[Profile](https://demos.creative-tim.com/purity-ui-dashboard/#/admin/profile?ref=docs-pud)).
